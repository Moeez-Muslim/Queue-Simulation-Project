# Queue-Simulation-Project
The Queue Simulation Project is a Java-based discrete-event simulation that models a dynamic queuing system. In this simulation, customers arrive at a service facility, potentially wait in line, and are served by available servers. The goal is to analyze and understand customer service times, waiting times, and overall system efficiency.
