# Queue-Simulation-Project
The Queue Simulation Project is a Java-based discrete-event simulation that models a dynamic queuing system. In this simulation, customers arrive at a service facility, potentially wait in line, and are served by available servers. The goal is to analyze and understand customer service times, waiting times, and overall system efficiency.

## Features

- **Event-Driven Simulation:** Core simulation based on discrete-event architecture.
  
- **Dynamic Server Management:** Intelligent server management with waiting queues and reservations.

- **Statistics Tracking:** Comprehensive statistics, including average waiting time and customer service metrics.

- **Modular Design:** Encapsulated components for easy modification and extensibility.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Queue-Simulation-Project.git
```

## Usage

1. **Compile the Code:**
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Compile the Java code using your preferred development environment or by running `javac *.java` in the terminal.

2. **Run the Simulation:**
   - Run the simulation using `java Simulator`.

3. **Explore Results:**
   - After simulation completion, review the generated event logs and statistics to understand the queuing system's behavior.

## Modifying the Simulation

The project is designed with modularity in mind. Feel free to modify or extend components such as events, servers, or statistics to suit your specific requirements.
